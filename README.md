# Student-Success

## Overview

This repository is meant to demonstrate my contributions to the group project "NYC-Student-Success-Predictions," which can be found in its unedited form here: https://github.com/divish16/NYC-Student-Success-Predictions

The goal of the overall project was **to identify and visualize correlations between student demographic data and student success metrics in NYC high schools.**

My role in this project was fourfold:
- Extracting, cleaning, and transforming the datasets for use in visualizations and machine learning (using Python/Pandas in Jupyter Notebook)
- Creating all visualizations in Tableau
- Creating the first machine learning model as a template (a multiple linear regression model using RandomForestRegressor)
- Writing content and providing some minor styling for the group Heroku website, available here: https://nyc-success-predictions.herokuapp.com/
