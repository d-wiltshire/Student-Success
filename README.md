# Student-Success

## Overview

This repository is meant to demonstrate my contributions to the group project "NYC-Student-Success-Predictions," which can be found in its unedited form here: https://github.com/divish16/NYC-Student-Success-Predictions

The goal of the overall project was **to identify and visualize correlations between student demographic data and student success metrics in NYC high schools.**

My role in this project was fourfold:
- Extracting, cleaning, and transforming the datasets for use in visualizations and machine learning (using Python/Pandas in Jupyter Notebook)
- Creating all visualizations in Tableau
- Creating the first machine learning model as a template (a multiple linear regression model using RandomForestRegressor)
- Writing content and providing some minor styling for the group Heroku website, available here: https://nyc-success-predictions.herokuapp.com/

## Visualizations 

My focus was to visualize relationships between poverty metrics and student success metrics like graduation rates. The visualizations suggest that there may be correlations between these two groups, but correlation is not causation. 

Our group's overall conclusion was that student success is likely affected by a number of factors not in our dataset, and demographic information cannot be considered predictive of student success. However, the correlations are striking and may describe trends that could be clarified with future research. 

Screenshots of sample visualizations can be found below. Please visit our Heroku site ([https://nyc-success-predictions.herokuapp.com/](https://nyc-success-predictions.herokuapp.com/visualizations.html)) to view additional visualizations and interact with the data.
